<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a proud Mumbaikar and completed all my education until 12th grade in Mumbai. 
  I spent my freshman year looking at a pc-screen cooped up at my house. During this period 
  I explored a lot of different things from Android development to Autonomous Robotics. I am interested 
  in the field of bio-computations and Deep learning. I am currently Sub-Head At Technology Robotixs Society.
  I play games like Minecraft and CS:GO. I am also one of the founding members of Monke gaming Club. 
  I love to spend some time sleeping and watching some series (Cough Weeb Cough!!) and read some novels. 
  I like the writings of Dan Brown and Agatha christie. Feel free to contact me for some new book 
  recommendations, I seriously need them.
