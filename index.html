        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a proud Mumbaikar and completed all my education until 12th grade in Mumbai. I spent my freshman 
          year staring at a PC-screen cooped up at my house. During this period, I explored a lot of different things, 
          from Android development to Autonomous Robotics. I am interested in bio-computations and Deep learning. I am 
          currently Sub-Head at Technology Robotixs Society. I play games like Minecraft and CS:GO. I am also one of the 
          founding members of Monke gaming Club. I love to spend some time sleeping and watching some series (Cough Weeb Cough!!)
           and read some novels. I like the works of Dan Brown and Agatha christie. Feel free to contact me for some new 
           book suggestions. I seriously need them.
